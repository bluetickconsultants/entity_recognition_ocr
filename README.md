<h2>   Entity Recognition on images using OCR </h2>
<hr>

An entity can be a word or series of words that consistently refer to the same thing. Every detected entity is classified into a prelabelled category. For example, a NER model might detect the word “London” in a text and classify it as a ‘Geography’.
But we need to find the entities from the images. So for this purpose, we need to extract text from the images, so for extracting text we are a technique called OCR.

<h1> What is Optimal character recognition(OCR)? </h1>
<hr>

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is widespread technology to recognize text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos. OCR is used to convert any kind of image containing text like(typed handwritten or printed) into machine-readable text format.

For extracting the text we are using open-source software called tesseract which can be implemented using the Pytesseract package.
